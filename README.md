#  Hi, I'm Li Productions!

I'm an **AI and tech enthusiast** with a year of hands-on coding and project experience. I enjoy experimenting with Python, building websites, and exploring new projects. I leverage AI in my work and always try to understand what it creates for me.  

 My recent project is **SyntheraQR â€” Ultra-Modern QR Code Generator**.
