AI and tech enthusiast with a year of hands-on coding and project experience. I enjoy experimenting with Python, building websites, and exploring new projects. I leverage AI in my work and always try to understand what it creates for me. My recent project is SyntheraQR â€” Ultra-Modern QR Code Generator.
